EditorSculpt

What's New:
<1.51>
-Fixed bug that you cann't UNDO with the edit/UNDO menu in Editor Sculpt 1.50.

-Fixed bug that a animation clip goes wrong when you cancel the "Save AnimationClip" dialog.

<v1.50>
-Now, Editor Sculpt can sculpt not only the mesh vertices but also sculpt the bones for the animations!
 2 new brushes enables you to do that.

-Add the new brush "Animation Move" brush.
 This brush is the released version of "BETA_BoneMove" brush in Editor Sculpt1.42 or before.
 This brush is similar to "Move" brush, but it moves the bones for animation, not the meshe vertices.

 You can select the time of animation with changing the value of the slider.

-Editor Sculpt saves the bones for animation to the animation clip automatically 
 when you sculpt and change the value of the "Animation Time" slider.
 The animation clip has compatibility to Unity's Mecanim Animation System, so you can edit that animation clip with Unity's
 Animation tools.

-"Animation Move" brush supports both Generic and Humanoid animations. But, for the best performance,
 I recommend that you should use humanoid animation bones.
 Because you can sculpt with additional feature such as the bone angle limitation or the bone symmetry.

-"Animation Move" brush has ability to edit the pose of the existing animation clip too.
 You see the "Select Aniamtions" popup in the Editor Sculpt window when you select "Animation Move" brush.
 Then you can select animation clip to edit with selecting the "[Import a Aniamtion]" option in the popup.

-Add th new brush "Animation Tip" brush. this brush is similar to "Animation Move" brush, but it can only move 
the tips of the models, such as the tips of the finger or tips of the foot.

-Move EditorSculpt menu from top of the menu to "Tools" menu.
You can start EditorSculpt by "Tools/EditorSculpt/AdvancedSculpt" in the menu.

-Fixed bug that with some conditions EditorSculpt doesn't appear in the menu and you can't start.

-Up to date with Unity 5.3.5f1.

-Fixed bug that "Decal" brush does'nt work.
Still it does'nt work in perspective editor camera. To use decal brush change editor camera to iso/orthographic.
And marked "Decal" brush as work in progress beta brush.

-Add possibility to access work in progress beta brush.
You can find that in menu "Tools/EditorSculpt/Extra/Try Beta Brushes".

-Change build tool from Visual Studio2015 to MonoDevelop.
And some ".dll" file name has been changed.
No problem found with that. But, if you work safely, delete "EditorSculpt" folder in the project which EditorSculpt 1.00 installed before updating EditorSculpt 1.01.

-Add "Enable Debug Mode" option in "Advanced Options". This shows various infomation of brush and mesh to Unity console.

-Add mesh resolution infomation in the EditorSculpt window,
not only for AutoRemesh Sculpt but also Standard Sculpt.
You can find that in "EditMesh" foldout.

-Various small bug fix.

-"BETA_Texture" brush has improved a lot.But, still it's in work in progress beta.
